@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a basic Tx-only 
or Rx-only application between two Devices.

The Device can be
   - a STM32WL Nucleo board
The applications aims to show a simple TX-RX RF link between two devices, one 
will be called Tx the other will be called Rx.
If the #define TRANSMITTER is uncommented, the device will acts as a transmitter and wiill transmit a known payload message, "STM32WL TX" every 2 seconds.
If the #define RECEIVER is uncommented, the device will act as a receiver and receives the payload message from the transmitter continously. 

The transmissions and receptions from the respective devices are logged via hyperterminal.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on the STM32WLxx Nucleo board.

  - STM32WLxx Nucleo board Set-up
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B
      to ST-LINK connector.
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector jumpers are fitted.

  - Configure the software via the configuration files:
    - sys_conf.h, radio_conf.h, mw_log_conf.h, main.h, etc

  -Set Up:

             --------------------------          --------------------------

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Open subghz_phy_app.c, on line 52, uncomment #define TRANSMITTER to configure the device as such
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Do the same for the second board, open subghz_phy_app.c, on line 52, uncomment #define RECEIVER to configure the device as such
  - Reset the board with the RECIEVER program to run the program
  - Reset the board with the TRANSMITTER program to run the program  
  - Open two Terminals, each connected to their respective Device
  - UART Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control

@par How to debug ?
  - make sure the flag DEBUGGER_ENABLED to 1 in sys_conf.h
  - simpler to define the flag LOW_POWER_DISABLE to 1 as well
  - compile, download and attach
